  <h2 class='c009'>I</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa_25__65 c012'>TO make my title complete, it should read
“Hunting Indians in a Taxi-cab with a
Camera.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Nature lovers long since found out that
the camera was the best weapon to take into the
woods, and mighty hunters are now depicted as
using the auto to carry them to the wild and to
bring back their trophies.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was reserved for one of my friends to follow
the trail to the city of New York, as his happy
hunting ground and to hire a taxi-cab there for the
express purpose of hunting a desirable Tobacco Sign
Indian. After two days of vain search, he came
across a prize.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Indian stood, a splendid specimen, in Bleecker
street, in front of a combination barber and tobacco
store; he was nine feet, seven inches tall and was
standing on a two-foot pedestal, posing as a Herald
of Choice Tobacco; an ignominious position for such
a superb creature.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was purchased, after a deal of haggling over
the price, for he was minus a nose and was at that
time suffering from a bad weather crack extending
diagonally across his stomach, well up into his chest.</p>

<p class='c013'>An old man on the same street, who was engaged
to box and crate the Indian, was deeply interested
in him and also in the march of Time and the disappearance
of many of our traditions and relics in
this comparatively new country, and said to my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>friend, “You do well to purchase one of these figures,
for, sir, the Indians on the American continent is
fastly disappearing, both in flesh and wood.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was next sent to a cabinet maker to receive
surgical treatment—his rather serious wounds filled
up and a new hawk-like nose grafted on in a clever
manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>The proud owner writes, “I then turned him over
to the Sign-painter, to have his leather leggings,
his warlike feathers, and a few other accessories
cleaned up and retouched.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I got into some very interesting discussions with
the Sign-painter on High Art, what Art meant, and
various kindred topics, while my Indian was being
rejuvenated. I wish I could remember some of
these conversations with the local Knight of the
Brush, but we certainly discussed some of the loftiest
principles in his line of paint and color.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tacomus” was then sent to one of the largest
and most attractive country seats in Massachusetts,
where he has found a fitting home and now stands
on a small knoll, his earnest face turned towards
forest, hills, and streams; a noble addition to the
many charms of a far famed and beautiful estate.</p>

<p class='c013'>In his left hand Tacomus grasps a long barrelled
gun, originally a flint lock, a real gun which had seen
service and which he had when discovered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many go to gaze at him, admire, and express
themselves about this new comer. One child looked
way up and exclaimed, “His head is in the skies!”
then timidly touched his toes and ran away.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tacomus bears the name of an old Indian Chief,
who with his sons, first sold the land which is now
the town of Dudley, to Governor Winthrop’s representatives,
in old Colonial Days.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>My Nameless, Footless Squaw</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c014'>The proud possessor of this impressive Brave
says, “I felt that I had secured a great prize and an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>unusually handsome Indian. I also fondly thought
I was the first to discover the value of our old tobacco
signs for lawn decoration; but found later that a
woman had seized the idea first, and about fifteen
years before. Visiting her ‘Breezy Meadows,’ I
noticed that she had placed two old wooden Indians
near a veritable wigwam or tepee on her ‘Adopted
Farm!’ So to her I take off my hat and courteously
bow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This complimentary allusion is intended for me,
but I make no claim to this honor; it is difficult and
risky to try to prove oneself the first in any line of
discovery and no doubt there are scores of others
who have rescued these statues from oblivion, by
giving them a place of refuge.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the enthusiasm of this friend which suggested
to me the idea of collecting the best surviving
specimens of the Tobacco Sign Indian and I
soon found that I must take a hint from the modern
nature-lover, and do most of my hunting with the
aid of the camera.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>II</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa_25__65 c012'>MY first wish for an Indian was to add to
the effect of my wigwam. I’ve always
been rather partial to the Indian race
because there is a tradition (which cannot
be verified) that my great grandmother, Abigail
Eastman Webster, had a slight infusion of Indian
blood. She was a noble looking woman, I have been
told, with rather a dark skin and large black eyes.
Her son, Daniel Webster, possibly owed to her his
swarthy complexion and wonderful eyes, like “Lanterns
on a dark night,” as the Websters were mostly
of a florid complexion, and addicted to red hair.</p>

<p class='c013'>I feared my dear old Indian (my first purchase)
might look too much like an advertisement as he
carried a bunch of cigars in his right hand, so this
was removed and replaced by a tomahawk.</p>

<p class='c013'>Next I suspected my unnamed brave might feel
lonely; any way he looked so, as he was from the
busy Bowery of New York, so I begged friends to aid
me in providing him with an attractive spouse.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many hunted but in vain; at last there was a
squaw reported from Leicester, Mass., but alas! she
had lost both feet. With the usual pedal appendages
she would have cost $35.00, “but seeing as how she
was crippled, she might go for $15.00.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I bought her and she looks all right with her stumps
of ankles set deep in the ground and heavy stones
around them to keep her firmly planted. The
couple seem very real and human to me and I am
often startled in the twilight by coming on the pair
without thinking that they are always there. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>intend to put a Cupid in the bushes near by or
behind a sassafras tree, to make it a little more
exciting. I regret not giving them any names but
may do so, if I can decide on something appropriate.
I have a splendid portrait of Tecumseh, but that
name does not seem right.</p>

<p class='c013'>And what a long list there is; I will only give a few,
as Massasoit, Squanto, Black Hawk, Pontiac, Red
Jacket, Leather Stocking, Quizquiz, Katsa, Red
Cloud, Many Horns, Spotted Wolf, Yeh-toot-sah,
Yok-ki-e-to, and finally the name I like best, “Samoset,”
that good Indian who was the first to welcome
the Puritans in 1621, saying “Welcome Englishmen,
Welcome Englishmen!” He told the Pilgrims to
possess the land, as those to whom it had belonged
were swept away by a pestilence. So Samoset, it
shall be and the woman? No “set” to her for her
knees have no bend to them, “Squaw-without-feet”
is true and sounds like some of their queer names.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c014'>I own that I am a bit superstitious about Indians
and fancy I am liked and protected by them, after
several unusual experiences which I take this opportunity
to refer to the Society for Psychical Research.
In California, years ago, just after I had put up
my wigwam at home, I was barking as for the last
twenty years with a chronic bronchial irritation and
was urged to visit a remarkable healer who had
“suddenly been controlled by the spirit of a cultivated
woman, a medical missionary, who had been most
successful in India but who had died after a few
years of brilliant practice.” Making an engagement
two weeks in advance, which was necessary, owing
to the great rush to be cured, I took a massage treatment
and greatly enjoyed the talk of the returned
missionary, which was all at once broken up by her
place in the rubber’s mind being usurped by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>powerful American Indian who, through the medium,
kept up a vigorous yet not rough rubbing, slapping and
putting hot hands all about my throat; talking too
as he worked, so enthusiastically. I think he was a
pretty knowing individual for this is what he said.
“Ugh! Ugh! Wah! Wah! This Squaw, she talkem
heapum, she now quite bad off, but Ugh Wah! we
patch her up! Will make her pokagee! Yes,
Pokagee!” Then he left as quickly as he came and
I noticed that poor Mrs. Seldon was breathing hard
and was in a profuse perspiration. When she opened
her eyes, she sighed and inquired in her own quiet,
gentle way, “Have you had a good rub?” That
evening, I went to a Reception for some of the Professors
of Stanford University with the promise
of being “Pokagee” still in my head and as one of
the gentlemen was a teacher of the Indian languages
and dialects, I ventured in a timid, hesitating manner
to inquire “May I ask if there is such a word as
Pokagee in any Indian dialect?”</p>

<p class='c013'>And the learned man replied at once, “Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Please tell me what it means.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is used to express cured, or in perfect health.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“O, thank you,” I said, “and just one more
question—what tribe has that word?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Pottawatamie.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And strange to relate my Astral Masseur had
belonged to that particular tribe. I forgot to say
that he spoke of his pleasure over the Tepee I had
built on my grounds and said the Indians long ago
loved to walk and hunt in my woods. And he
added, “They like to go to Tepee now; seems like
their own place.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again a friend took me to one of the best known
and most valued medical women in New York for a
shampoo and a treatment of my face which certainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>did need to be steamed and electrified. Imagine
the general astonishment when another Indian
spirit kindly “controlled” the masseuse, (something
which she affirmed had never happened before) and
he wished to encourage me about my heart as several
doctors still in the flesh had been criminally or at
least brutally frank about its condition and I was
naturally alarmed. And he said “No need worry
about heart; you no got bad heart, only what I call
nervous heart. You got scared but you stay out
doors and let books alone. When you go home go
to the Tepee and stand by it, and some of us will go
walk with you. We are often there.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Whatever that was, it did me much more good
than the physicians, who frightened me into an
abnormal and utterly useless despondency, but whose
charges were so high as to increase my temperature
and heart action. So me for the Medicine Man of
Mystery—with thanks. Excuse this personal digression.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa_25__65 c012'>LIKE his prototype, the stalwart Red man,
who once regarded this beautiful, broad
land as his own, the Tobacco Sign Indian
is now rapidly disappearing from all city
streets by order of officials because the figures encumber
places of business.</p>

<p class='c013'>He has a distinct genealogy for it is believed that
the wooden statue came first into existence in England
as a Tobacco sign because Sir Walter Raleigh,
who carried the plant back from his trip to America,
told of the Indian’s Pipe of Peace and the joys of
smoking, besides enjoying it himself. Naturally the
Brave himself should be used to advocate its use.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, it became the symbol of cigar stores both in
England and other countries, as the striped pole
belongs to the Barber, who in old times used to
bleed his patrons as well as shave them, and the
frisky Goat called attention to “Bock Beer.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon all of these will have gone.</p>

<p class='c013'>A great variety of such signs were found in New
York, and several other cities while hunting in a taxi.
The most common is the Brave gazing, with right
hand over brow; next an Indian Queen or a young
girl with a tobacco leaf or bunch of cigars in hand;
Squaw with Papoose; Minnehaha, a very pretty
girl, offering cigars; Punch and also Punchinello,
this last extremely comical both in face and figure.
The one whose photo you see here cost $50 at second
hand and the present owner would not sell it, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>says, for twice that sum. And as we scoot here and
there in all sorts of out of the way places, we see a
Policeman, a Baseball Player, a Hunter in appropriate
garb, a handsome Highland Chieftain. Cupid
is not omitted; of course not, he is popular and found
everywhere. Actors of the past generation have
been honored: Edwin Forrest as Metamora, and the
elder Sothern as Lord Dundreary. One of these
pictures was taken in front of a cigar store in Worcester,
the sign is nearly fifty years old and the
Indian was formerly the Figure Head of a merchant
vessel; if he could speak, wondrous tales of danger
and wild adventure would come from his lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>His owner would not take a fortune for him, so his
future is secure. This one is believed to be the
oldest Indian sign in New England as it is more than
75 years old. He is now kept inside the store for
fear of injury.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>IV</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa_25__65 c012'>THE Indian which has stood on top of
Tammany Hall for nearly forty years
deserves special mention. He was not
placed in that elevated position as a tobacco
sign, although a number of the modern chieftains
display cigars and tobacco in their liquor stores.
There is no significance connected with the figure in
that direction. One of the oldest Tammany Sachems
writes me that some one proposed an arched ornament
for the then fine building in Fourteenth street
in the year 1878, and the figure decided upon to
complete the effect was that of the Indian Chief
Tammenand, or St. Tammany, so called to make a
little fun of the various Saints of other organizations,
as St. Francis, St. Andrews and so on.</p>

<p class='c013'>My friend further says that in England and on the
Continent in early times, a favorite sign of tobacconists
was first a colored boy, then later an Indian
King or Queen. He adds, “I remember in my boyish
days many Indian figures, in front of cigar
shops; stalwart Indian Chiefs holding out a bunch
of cigars, or an Indian Princess with a Tobacco leaf.
Some of the latter were cleverly carved, ornamented
dress and scarf with usually one breast exposed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I read in a recent Daily, that a cook in New York,
minus work and a place to lay his head, took unwisely
three drinks and four knives and dashed out into
the crowded street, throwing up a knife to show his
dexterity as a juggler!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>In his excited condition, he happened to cut his
own hand; the sight of blood made him more wild,
and glaring at one of the wooden Indians who seemed
to be staring at him, he attacked him fiercely with
heavy hacks and thwacks until hurried away by a
passing policeman.</p>

<p class='c013'>This last fleeting statue even figures in one of the
World’s funny series of the trials of the “Newly
Weds.” That two toothed baby, who, with all his
pranks never ceases to fascinate, wanted one of
these Indians to take home and only closed his mouth
when his adoring and long-suffering Dad had bought
one and carried it along with them, with his befeathered
head sticking out one way and legs the
other. No doubt there are many capital jokes connected
with this subject, but the first one to look up
an odd theme has a hard hunt for facts. I know
that a well known Steel Magnate gave a beautiful
church to the town where his mother lived, at her
request.</p>

<p class='c013'>And not entirely satisfied, she next begged him to
get a statue of some Saint to make the gift perfect
and adorn the grounds. He promised, and soon a
long box came directed to his mother but alas! it
proved to be one of the wooden men, of which we are
talking. Her son was fond of practical jokes!</p>

<p class='c013'>A friend has told me that the Indians of Oklahoma
resent these representations of people of their race
and want to suppress them all. It is difficult to
find any in many of our large cities; photographers
write that they have been obliged to hunt not in a
taxi or auto, but by groping in store lofts and dark
attics and that then the figures must be taken
“down and out” to get a right light on them.</p>

<p class='drop-capa_25__65 c012'>TO show the genuine interest shown in my
collection I will offer one letter from a
business man in Worcester, Mass:</p>
<p class='c015'>“Dear Miss Sanborn:—I have come
across these figures and think you may use them.
They are good examples of their craft and are quite
clear. First Punch, he is over eighty years old and
is whole from his knee down. I haven’t taken his
face because he would have to be got down in order
to do so, but if you say you do want it and can wait
a week for it I am perfectly willing to take same and
not have the other one show; really he has a strong
face and I can, no doubt, get a good clean picture,
front view.</p>

<p class='c016'>Am going to tell you all I can remember about
them; if it is of no use to you, no harm is done.</p>

<p class='c016'>First: The Squaw, stands in front of a store; her
owner has had same about ten years; she has a lovely
face as you see and originally came from Boston.</p>

<p class='c016'>Second, Punch, formerly owned by a German,
claimed there were but two like it in this country.</p>

<p class='c016'>Third, “Humpty Dumpty,” a likeness of the
original Geo. L. Fox, who was the original “Humpty
Dumpty.” In conversation with Mr. Sawyer, he said
that how he happened to get the figure was thus: “A
man in Woonsocket, R.I., took it for a bill due him;
he in turn had means of getting rid of a lot of tobacco
among the fishermen of Gloucester, so he gave the
sign for the tobacco which he in turn sold to the
fishermen at Gloucester. Now should you care for
any of these, I’ll do them all under one consideration.
No more pay; you have overpaid me already for the
little I have been able to do and I’m unwilling to
accept any more.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>I desire also to heartily thank Mr. Jacob Riis,
who is one of the busiest and kindest men in New
York. He allowed me to use his description in his last
book, “The Old Town,” of an Indian who was a
chum of his in childhood and he writes me that he
has sent home to Ribe for a special picture of the
Sign he describes. Here is his story of his friend.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We boys in the Old Town were strictly prohibited
from smoking under the School rules, which prescribed
the rod for every offence. In consequence,
we did it on the sly, thinking it manly and fine. At
his desk at home, Father smoked all the time, and
so did everybody else. Many a pound of Kanaster
have I carried home from the tobacconist’s shop, the
one in Gronnegade, with the naked brown Indian
smoking a very long pipe.</p>

<p class='c016'>“From the moment the ‘Last of the Mohicans’
fell into my hands, I looked upon him as a friend
and brother. There was something between us
which the grown-ups knew nothing about. He must
be acquainted with Uncas and Chingachgook and
Deerslayer, for he was of the good Delawares and
not of the wicked Hurons.</p>

<p class='c016'>“He swings from his hook yet, and I confess to a
nodding acquaintance when I pass him in the street.
His pipe is still the biggest part.” In one of Mr.
Riis’ letters he says, “Certainly you may use the
Indian in the Old Town and here is a picture of him.
He is fixed now on the wall. In my childhood he
swung from a hook smoking his long pipe. You
merely see the hand that holds it in this picture.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Good luck with your book and with all your work.</p>

live.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa_25__65 c012'>HERE’S a New York Politician’s opinion
about the Indians he knew. “Say, Spielberg,
were you in the Assembly at Albany
in 1901?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, this is only my second term. Let me explain
how they do things up there. I went there, full of
enthusiasm for the public service. Being a new
member, I scarcely expected to get on one of the
big committees, but I thought I was entitled to
something. The Speaker put me on the Indian
Affairs Committee. The only Indians I knew anything
about were the braves of the Tammany tribe,
but I was willing to learn. I read the works of J.
Fenimore Cooper so as to get posted on Indian
Affairs. When I got a pretty good grip on the
subject I waited for a meeting of my committee,
but couldn’t find any. Near the close of the session
I went to an old member of the Legislature and
asked him if there were any Indians in the state and
if so what was I supposed to do for them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Indians in New York?’ he came back. ‘Plenty of
them. You come from Manhattan and must have
noticed a number of them in front of cigar stores
with uplifted tomahawks. These Indians are exposed
to all kinds of weather and it is your duty
to observe the weather effect and be ready to report
on the same when the committee meets.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“I asked him when the committee did meet and
he said, ‘I have been here for the past six years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>and it has not met yet, but it is likely to meet any
day.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>Sometimes tobacco signs are painted on boards,
and of such a curious example is to be seen at the
door of a small establishment bearing the sonorous
name of the “Mephisto Cigar Store.”</p>

Indian whose ranks are thinning so rapidly, that
within a comparatively few years more, the race will
be obliterated by the advance of the white man’s
civilization. That is rather a rosy way of describing
the treatment the Indian has received.</p>

<p class='c013'>The proposed statue will be colossal in size and of
bronze in construction, with outstretched arm,
typifying a greeting from the primal American to
the people of all other nations.</p>

<p class='c013'>That might be well represented by “Samoset,”
illustrating the finer, better traits of the Indian,
when he cried out a “Welcome, Englishmen” to the
strangers who were landing.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have dwelt so much on this theme that I’m
actually confusing the real Indian with a wooden
statue. Never mind. Did you know that Schiller
wrote an Indian Death song?</p>

<p class='c013'>I’ll quote a few verses:</p>

<p class='drop-capa_25__65 c012'>I&nbsp;am told that a Collector went about in Baltimore
twenty years ago and bought up all the
best of these signs in that city, for their carving
was often admirable, spirited, and artistic.
A friend sends me an interesting history of that
“Ancient Baltimorean, the Cigar Store Indian,”
written in 1908 for a paper of that city.</p>

<p class='c013'>On good authority, it is stated that there are
2,000 tobacco stores in Baltimore. One finds them
in all parts of the city, on street corners, in basements,
in the middle of blocks and fronting alleys.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is estimated that 150 of these 2,000 tobacco
stores are identified by a wooden figure just as a
barber shop is identified by a ribbon-striped pole.
The wooden figures are almost always found to
represent an Indian, although occasionally there are
other figures.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so they may be found differing in size, coloring,
ornamentation, state of repair and general condition,
or rather, in most cases, general debility.</p>

<p class='c013'>To review the history of these Indians one would
naturally look to a tobacconist of age, with years in
the business of dealing in and manufacturing of
smokers’ articles, and in interviewing several of such
many facts of interest may be learned.</p>

<p class='c013'>The oldest tobacconist in Baltimore is venerable
Mr. Caspari, of Calvert street, one of whose figures
was mentioned above.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Caspari’s story of the Indian is as follows:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“The first figures were made by ship carpenters
125 years ago and were carved out of lengths of old
seasoned masts.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In those days of individual effort and prosperity
cigar stores were few and far between, and for a
sign to identify them they used the figure of an
Indian, because from the Indian, the white man
first received tobacco.</p>

<p class='c013'>“At first the figure was painted on each side of a
board. This was placed in front of the store. From
that evolved the carving of the figure from solid
wood as a new idea and more attractive and progressive,
as well as more expensive and valuable.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Fifty years ago no tobacconist would think of
opening a store without a figure. Now the men in
the trade think that to put an Indian out is to waste
money.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When I started business, in 1861, my stock cost
me $30, and I had a figure that cost $40. I had to
have the sign, though it cost more money than the
stock inside. Since then I have been 46 years in
business on one (Calvert) street,” said Mr. Caspari.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1864 he hired a man from New York to make
figures for him. The first figure was a small one,
representing an Indian squaw. This was sold in
Baltimore in 1865 and brought $15.</p>

<p class='c013'>These figures were made out of old masts. Each
one was handmade with saw, knife, chisel and such
tools of the trade. The sculptor would work on five
or six different ones in turn and take, on an average,
about a week’s time to finish a figure.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Caspari has sold figures in many other towns
and cities.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the old days, customers coming in and wanting a
figure would choose some new design, and so “Girls
of the Period” were next in vogue. These were
fanciful, flashy figures and very attractive.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“Pipitone, on Charles street, near Baltimore,
years ago bought one of these fancy figures,” said
Mr. Caspari, “and soon after a storm blew it to
Baltimore street, damaging it badly. He brought
it back and had it repaired and painted and about
two months after that a horse ran away and the
wagon caught the figure and broke it to pieces.”</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa_25__65 c012'>IN 1868 or 1870 “Fritz in Ireland” was acted
by J. K. Emmet at the Holliday Street Theatre,
in Baltimore, and the actor sang his famous lullaby
to one of these “Girls of the Period” figures.
After these Mr. Caspari offered drum majors, represented
with Uncle Sam breeches and clothed to correspond.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then came “Champagne Charley,” with side
whiskers, red coat, striped trousers and holding a
bottle in one hand, at which he pointed a finger of the
other.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then came the soldier. This figure carried a
genuine old musket.</p>

<p class='c013'>Next appeared the “Scotch Girl,” with Tam-o-shanter
and plaid dress, like a bag-pipe player.</p>

<p class='c013'>With a large assortment of figures on exhibit to
choose from, Mr. Caspari did a good business.
Every cigar store that started had one.</p>

<p class='c013'>New customers looking about for a figure would
come in with a new idea and new designs would be
made to order. Mr. Caspari had 100 figures on
exhibition at one time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Last were made Punches and clowns. This was
about 20 years ago. After that the trade fell off
and the stock was sold out.</p>

<p class='c013'>The value of figures depended on the size, amount
of work and time necessary to finish them and on
their newness of design and ornamentation. They
cost new, from $15 up to $250. One Mr. Caspari
sold for $400.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>He bought a little darky figure at one time on
Pratt street that had resisted the elements for 150
years. This little figure was about 30 inches high.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the war, on a St. Patrick’s Day, he dressed
the darky in a green coat, with a clover leaf and tall
hat. An Irish soldier came along and, seeing the
darky, became incensed and knocked it off its block,
exclaiming vehemently against its being an Irish
“nigger.”</p>

<p class='c013'>On another St. Patrick’s Day a drunken Irishman,
seeing the darky in similar patriotic regalia, made
such a disturbance that a policeman had to be called.</p>

<p class='c013'>Figures were sold all over Baltimore and were
repaired frequently. Some were more exposed to
the elements than others. Some were of such
design that portions were more easily broken off
than was the case with others.</p>

<p class='drop-capa_25__65 c012'>TO repaint a figure cost from $10 to $15. They
were always painted flashily with high-grade
paint and trimmings of genuine gold
or silver or whatever metal was called for.
Some had earrings, others beads, bracelets or necklaces
to repaint fancifully. Then the feathers of the
Indian required the highest artistic blending of
colors.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Caspari had scores of paint pots used in
connection with this branch of his business. Each
held a different colored paint.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a rule figures required repainting every 18
months, although Mr. Fricke’s Indian, bought 25
years ago, has had but three coats of paint.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But they never could get the color again as it was
at first,” says Mr. Fricke.</p>

<p class='c013'>The 2-foot law as applied to obstructions of sidewalks
has been one of the main causes for the removal
of the Indian and such figures.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Hutchingson has in front of his store on Gay
street an Indian maiden which came into his possession
with other stock in 1896. A former owner once
recognized it and stated that he had had it for 30
years.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Hutchingson says this is the only Indian that
experienced and survived the big fire of 1904. The
Church of the Messiah, corner of Gay and Fayette
streets, was the only church that burned, and this
Indian saw it burn and was herself blistered and
cracked. Since then she has had a new coat of paint.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>George Eikenberg, on East Fayette street, has
had a figure in front of his store for 30 years.
Mr. Decker, of North Gay street, above Belair
Market, has an Indian made by a Mr. Gato on
North Caroline street. Mr. Decker bought it in
1879, and the only repairing done has been on one
arm that was accidentally broken off. It has been
painted every two years and has always done good
service.</p>

<p class='c013'>Incidentally, Mr. Gato, the sculptor, was a short
man and had to stand on a chair to carve part of the
Indian, which is itself a small one.</p>

<p class='drop-capa_25__65 c012'>MISS Wurach, 733 West Pratt street, Baltimore,
states that her father started in
business 51 years ago and that she and her
brother now continue to keep the store,
her father being dead. The figure in front is the
second one used in 51 years. The age of the present
figure is not known.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Bringman’s Indian figure, on West Baltimore
street, is very old and very impressive in appearance,
being of unusually large size and displaying great
muscular development. It has required much repairing
about the feet and on one thigh.</p>

<p class='c013'>Very interesting is the story of F. Dreves’ figure,
on West Fayette street, above Park avenue, as told
by Mr. Dreves.</p>

<p class='c013'>The late Mr. Dreves, Sr., at one time dealt in
Indian figures.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sailing vessels that for a long time plied up and
down the coast of America and across the Atlantic
carrying merchandise and passengers would become
unfit for further use at sea and were then dismantled.</p>

<p class='c013'>Often the masts of these old sailing vessels would
be trailed in the water and towed into port. These
portions of masts would, in the water, become
hardened, or even petrified. They were of large
size and furnished excellent material for wood
carving of all kinds.</p>

<p class='c013'>About 35 years ago the late Mr. Dreves obtained
two lengths of such masts and wished to have two
Indian figures carved from them.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>He found a German sculptor from Munich who
had carved figures now to be seen adorning the
Capitol at Washington.</p>

<p class='c013'>The German sculptor had never seen an Indian,
but when shown pictures of the figures he was to
carve exclaimed: “O yes, that’s the American,”
meaning that the Indian was the only native American.</p>

<p class='c013'>Each Indian completed cost $115 in the raw wood.</p>

<p class='drop-capa_25__65 c012'>THE Indians carved by the German sculptor
are represented with catamount hide for
covering. A quiver of arrows is fastened
over the left shoulder. In the right hand is a
bow and the left hand holds a bunch of tobacco leaves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidence of the skill and training of the now
departed German sculptor may be seen in the figure.
Every muscle visible on the human form is executed
in its exact relation.</p>

of the shinbone and the condyles of the elbow joint

by Mr. Oppelt and may now be seen in front of his

father 35 years ago for about the price of carving and
material as given above.</p>

<p class='drop-capa_25__65 c012'>JOHN E. Owens made a great hit with his
popular play “The Live Indian,” in which
he took down and hid a stunning figure, that
had stood many years before a cigar store,
in fact considered to be one of “the oldest inhabitants.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Made up as an exact counterpart of this, he
mounted the pedestal and waited until midnight,
when he broke into the store, and hastened away,
rich in booty; not leaving, however, till he had replaced
the insulted Indian in his rightful place.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was an irresistibly comical sight.
But the wooden Indian must go; his death knell
has been rung. In the old days, a cigar store without
this symbol, would be as lacking in life as a one
ring Circus at the present time. All has changed:
you can walk street after street in any city, and
pass tobacco stores by the score but your old friend
is not there. Tobacco sales are now managed by
advertisements and gaudy lithographs of chorus
girls smoking cigarettes, or fancy pictures just to
catch the eye. These are the new favorites and soon
the Indian Sign will be obsolete; a relic of the ages.</p>

<p class='c013'>This fact suggested making a collection to preserve
his memory.</p>

<p class='c013'>I fancy I hear some one say, “This seems to end
rather abruptly.” That is true; but just as Horace
Greeley said, “The way to resume is to resume,” I
think the way to stop is to stop. And it is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>triumph of self control in a woman to stop short
when she really has nothing more to communicate.</p>

<p class='c013'>I hope that this little historic Souvenir, will be
desired by every man who smokes and every woman
who “loves the odor of a good cigar.” Like Col.
Sellers, I have prepared a bottle for each eye.</p>

<p class='c013'>And now in a whisper let me close with a treasonable
quotation from Kipling:</p>

is a smoke!”</p>
